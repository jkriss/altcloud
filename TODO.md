- get let's encrypt working
- integration tests for subdomains and access rules
- set up properly for npm (including license)

- make sure etags/not modified works with non-files (e.g. collections)
- add disallowed user name handling (can't start with ., no "all", "authorized")
- add (optional?) rejection of bad passwords (too short, on bad password list, etc)
- allow absolute paths in layout specification
- merge .passwords up the tree, too?
- fix unhandled promise rejection on bad liquid template code
