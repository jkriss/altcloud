- fix subdomain directory redirect (it's not just appending /)
- add collections/indexes back in?
- integration tests for subdomains and access rules
- add disallowed user name handling
- add (optional) rejection of bad passwords (too short, on bad password list, etc)
- allow absolute paths in layout specification
- merge .passwords up the tree, too
- maybe use liquid instead of handlebars for safe evaluation
